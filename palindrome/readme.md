> * Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

> * For example,
"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" is a palindrome.
"race a car" is not a palindrome.

> * Note:
Have you consider that the string might be empty? This is a good question to ask during an interview.

> * For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.

------
1. 空字符串或单个字符看作回文
2. 若含有特殊字符，忽略特殊字符，只关注字母
3. 忽略大小写
4. 题目描述不够具体，通过平台提交代码报错来看，数字也考虑在内
